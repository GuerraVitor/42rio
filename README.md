# 42 Rio - Common Core Projects

Welcome to my repository for the 42 Rio Common Core curriculum! This space is dedicated to storing all the projects, exercises, and code I develop during my journey at 42.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a personal archive of my progress and solutions for the various projects required by the 42 programming school. It's a way to:

- Track my learning and development.
- Review and improve my past code.
- Showcase the work and skills acquired.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The repository is organized by project, following the structure of the 42 curriculum. You will find folders for each "Piscine" (Pool) and subsequent projects.

Example structure:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ C00/
â”œâ”€â”€ C01/
â”œâ”€â”€ libft/
â””â”€â”€ ... and so on
```

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer-to-peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills.
